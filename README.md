# Project idea
npm run build

The project aims to facilitate the process for thrift stores that work with items on consignment

The application makes it possible to create clients, products entries, products sales.

The idea is that each customer can also be a clothing supplier

As the sale is made on consignment, the supplier will only have credit when the item is sold.

For each sold item, the client that brought will receive 20% (on future will be configurable) that can be used as credit for next purchase or withdrawn

Credit to a client should allways be aproved before going to the user's account

The application also should accept products that are not consignment and won't create any credit for any client
